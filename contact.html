        I am ambitious and driven. I thrive on challenge and constantly set
        goals for myself, so I have something to strive towards. I am not
        comfortable with settling, and I am always looking for an opportunity to
        do better and achieve greatness.

      <p>
        I am passionate about my work. Because I love what I do, I have a steady
        source of motivation that drives me to do my best. In my last job, this
        passion led me to challenge myself daily and learn new skills that
        helped me to do better work.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am highly organised. I always take notes, and I use a series of tools
        to help myself stay on top of deadlines. I like to keep a clean
        workspace and create a logical filing method so Iâ€™m always able to find
        what I need. I find this increases efficiency and also helps the rest of
        the team stay on track.
